# Check rtl/snac_psx.v against the canonical copy, or refresh the stamp.
#
# rtl/snac_psx.v is copied from the AmigaCD userspace repo, which owns it (the
# AmigaCD core carries a copy too, not the original). MiSTer core
# repositories are self-contained Quartus projects with no submodule or package
# step anywhere in the toolchain, so copying is the platform's convention; the
# cost of that convention is drift, and this is the control for it.
#
# Two modes:
#
#   ./snac_vendor_check.sh                      Verify the local copy still
#                                               hashes to what rtl/snac_psx.vendor
#                                               records. This is what CI runs:
#                                               it needs no second checkout and
#                                               catches the copy being edited
#                                               here, which is the common case.
#
#   ./snac_vendor_check.sh /path/to/amigacd     Also diff against a real
#                                               checkout of the canonical repo,
#                                               which is the only way to catch
#                                               the canonical side having moved.
#
#   ./snac_vendor_check.sh --stamp /path/...    Re-vendor: copy the module and
#                                               bench across and rewrite the
#                                               stamp. Run the bench afterwards.
#
# CI deliberately runs only the first mode. A job here cannot read the other
# repository without a token configured for it, and a check that silently
# degrades to "skipped" when the token is absent is worse than no check at all.
